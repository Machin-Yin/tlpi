Source Code for The Linux Programming Interface
The source code for the program examples in TLPI is provided in two versions:

* **Distribution version**: a tarball of the source code that includes extra material not shown in the book. Probably, this is the version of the code that you want.

* **Book version**: a tarball of the source code as it appears in the book.
